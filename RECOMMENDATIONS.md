# AI-Powered Recommendation System

## Overview

The Hybrid LMS includes a comprehensive AI-powered recommendation system that provides personalized course recommendations to users based on their learning history, preferences, and interactions with the platform.

## Features

### 1. Multiple Recommendation Algorithms

The system implements several recommendation algorithms:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends courses based on similar users' preferences
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends courses based on user's content preferences
3. **Popularity-Based**: Recommends popular courses with high enrollment and ratings
4. **Knowledge-Based**: Recommends courses based on explicit rules and knowledge
5. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple algorithms for better recommendations

### 2. User Profiling

The system creates detailed user profiles including:

- Preferred categories and difficulty levels
- Learning history (completed and viewed courses)
- Interaction patterns and preferences
- Feature vectors for machine learning algorithms

### 3. Interaction Tracking

Tracks various user interactions:

- Course views
- Enrollments
- Completions
- Ratings
- Wishlists
- Searches

### 4. Feedback System

Allows users to provide feedback on recommendations:

- Helpful
- Not Helpful
- Irrelevant
- Misleading

## API Endpoints

### Recommendations

- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/` - List current recommendations
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/{id}/` - Get specific recommendation
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/generate/` - Generate new recommendations
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/{id}/click/` - Mark recommendation as clicked
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/{id}/feedback/` - Submit feedback

### User Profile

- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/profile/` - Get user recommendation profile
- `PUT /api/v1/recommendations/profile/` - Update user recommendation profile

### Interaction Tracking

- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/track-interaction/` - Track course interaction

### Feedback

- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/feedback/` - List feedback

### Settings

- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/settings/` - Get recommendation settings
- `PUT /api/v1/recommendations/settings/` - Update recommendation settings

## Management Commands

- `python manage.py generate_recommendations --all` - Generate recommendations for all users
- `python manage.py generate_recommendations --user-id 1` - Generate recommendations for specific user
- `python manage.py generate_recommendations --force` - Force refresh recommendations
